Gisrep
======

The command line Github issues reporter, making requests with
`PyGithub <https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub>`__ and formatting results with
`jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/>`__.

Installation
------------

::

    pip install gisrep

This installs the ``gisrep`` script to the command line.

Usage
-----

You can type ``gisrep --help`` to see guidance on how to use the script.

Publishing reports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Publishing reports uses the ``report`` subcommand and a query for the `Github search
API <https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-issues>`__:

::

    gisrep report "repo:briggySmalls/gisrep is:open label:enhancement"

Which will print a summary of the issues to the console:

::

    - Make project open-source friendly [#2]
    - Add custom errors and improve handling [#4]
    - Add coverage tests [#14]
    - Allow user to provide jinja2 environment configuration [#16]
    ...

Read the Github guide on `searching issues and
pull
requests <https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/>`__
for help constructing queries.

Formatting results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issues can be formatted with templates - either those shipped with gisrep, or custom user templates.

::

    # Specify gisrep template tag
    gisrep report "repo:twbs/bootstrap is:open label:feature" --internal list_by_labels.html

    # Pass path of a user template
    gisrep report "repo:twbs/bootstrap is:open label:feature" --external ./custom-report.rst

To list the tags for built-in templates use the following command:

::

    gisrep list

Read the `templates
readme <gisrep/templates/README.rst>`__ for creating custom templates.

Private repositories
--------------------

The tool needs Github credentials in order to access private repositories.
Credentials can be provided as command line arguments directly, or supplied
in a `.gisreprc` config file.

A config file can be initialised and saved to your home directory with the following command:

::

    gisrep init

You will be prompted for your Github username and password. Note that if your Github
account uses 2 factor authentication, then the password provided to gisrep
should be a `personal access token
<https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/>`__.

The password is stored in your systemâ€™s password manager using
`keyring <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/keyring>`__.
