Gisrep
======

The command line Github issues reporter, powered by
`PyGithub <https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub>`__.

Installation
------------

::

    pip install gisrep

This installs the ``gisrep`` script to the command line.

Usage
-----

Publishing reports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Publishing reports uses the ``report`` subcommand:

::

    gisrep report simple_report.md "repo:twbs/bootstrap is:open label:feature" clipboard

The gisrep report subcommand comprises three components:

-  A Template (``simple_report.md``) to format issues
-  A Github search query (``"repo:twbs/..."``) to filter issues
-  An Output (``clipboard``) used to deliver the report

Templates
^^^^^^^^^

The template component can be either a tag for a built-in template, or a
filepath to a custom template. Read the `templates
readme <gisrep/templates/README.md>`__ for creating custom templates.

Github search query
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The search query is passed to the `Github search
API <https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-issues>`__ to filter
issues and pull requests. Read the Github guide on `searching issues and
pull
requests <https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/>`__
for help constructing queries.

Outputs
^^^^^^^

The output is a method of delivering the report. Defaults to printing to
the console.

Listing built-ins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Listing the available built-in templates or outputs uses the ``list``
subcommand.

To list the tags for built-in templates use the following command:

::

    gisrep list templates

To list the tags for built-in outputs use the following command:

::

    gisrep list outputs

Private repositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tool needs to be initialised with Github credentials in order to
access private repositories. The tool is initialised with the following
command:

::

    gisrep init

You will be prompted for your Github username and password. The password
is stored in your systemâ€™s password manager using
`keyring <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/keyring>`__. To overrwrite an
existing configuration use the ``--force`` argument.
